        <h2>Some Things!</h2>
        <p>When Arthas Menethil and the Scourge came to Quel'Thalas for the Sunwell, Sylvanas attempted to defend her homeland. After fighting and losing at every turn to his forces, Arthas killed her. In revenge for her stubbornness, he severed her soul from her body, forcing her to serve him and aid him in the destruction of her beloved city.

          During the time when the Lich King was losing grasp on his undead minions, Sylvanas gained her free will and plotted against him in Lordaeron with the help of the Nathrezim. After her assassination attempt failed, she turned her attention to claiming Lordaeron for herself. She bent the dreadlord, Varimathras, to her will and, with the help of the human remnants led by lord Garithos, killed Balnazzar and Detheroc. With the death of the dreadlords and Garithos, together with the disbanding of the human remnants, Sylvanas was able to claim Lordaeron and made her home under the former Capital City, naming it "The Undercity."</p>
